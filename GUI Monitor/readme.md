# Desc
- files needed to run and build my GUI in Rust

## Details
- 'so_cold' is the parent folder for the entire project
- 'src' is all the source code 
- 'examples' are temporary code I wrote for testing features 

## Notes 
- project is incomplete and abandoned as the new router that my family has no longer has the data page public
