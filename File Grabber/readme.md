# Desc
- Web scrapers with identical purpose, however, only functional one is chrome 

## Chrome scraper 
- Scrape Prof's website for lectures and hws that I don't have downloaded on device 
- Worked with Chrome binaries 

## Firefox scraper
- Attempt to rebuild project for firefox (my current browser) but need to make bigger chances 
- Firefox does not behave the same way as Chrome so same methods do not apply 

## Notes
- removed local paths
- there is a reason that the paths have two notations: ``path\dir`` vs ``path/dir`` 
	- first one is using path immediately so "/" is preferred
	- second is passing it to browser so "\\" is preferred which most likely OS dependant (Windows for me)
