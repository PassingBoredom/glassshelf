- files I used to build my airport webapp

## Details
- 'build' is a parent folder for my webapp that I submitted for the class 
    - WIP due to language and non-communicative collaborators (they never responded nor explained their intentions) 

- 'prod.bat' is a batch script that I wrote to act as my project builder
    - starts and ends SQL Database as I need 
    - copies and moves all files into production location then builds app 
    - Made this as a replacement to the depreciated tools that were given at the time 
    - Took awhile to make but made building the app much faster 

- 'SQL Commands' is my relational database that I designed and used 
    - It also has preset testing data that I needed for video submission
